📜 Title: Master Thesis in Electrical Engineering with Emphasis on Telecommunication Systems

🔬 This thesis, submitted in September 2022, explores the use of Decode and Forward Relay Assisting Active Jamming in a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) system. The study focuses on improving the security performance of the system by degrading the eavesdropper's channel using jamming techniques.

👨‍💻 The authors, Lakshmikanth Akurathi and Surya Teja Reddy Chilluguri, conducted this research under the guidance of their supervisor, Dr. Thi My Chinh Chu, at the Faculty of Telecommunication Systems, Blekinge Institute of Technology in Sweden.

🔧 The research methodology includes a literature review, mathematical analysis, and simulation using MATLAB to evaluate and analyze the system's performance in the presence of an eavesdropper when the jamming technique is applied.

🔑 The key findings of this study are:

1. Active jamming enhances the secrecy performance of the entire system and leads to a positive improvement in the secrecy rate.
2. The system model consists of two links: relay transmission path from source to Near User to Far User and direct transmission path from source to destination.
3. The network experiences Nakagami-m fading, and the authors used power allocation to allocate different power to users based on their channel condition.
4. The study evaluates secrecy performance metrics such as secrecy outage probability and secrecy capacity.

📈 The results and analysis section provides visualizations of the system's performance, including Transmitted Power vs. SINR/SNR of UE1 and UE2, Transmitted Power vs. Outage Probability of UE1, UE2, and NOMA, and Normalized Distance vs. Secrecy Capacity of NOMA System with/without Active Jamming.

💡 The authors believe that this research could contribute to the development of more secure and efficient NOMA systems in the future. They also suggest further research on the topic to improve the system's performance.

📚 The thesis includes an introduction, related work, system model, results and analysis, discussion, conclusions and future work, and a list of references.

Overall, this thesis presents us an exciting opportunity to explore the potential of Decode and Forward Relay Assisting Active Jamming in NOMA systems and its impact on security performance. The study's findings could have significant implications for the development of future wireless communication systems.
